      "47) I’m excited to join the  Daily Homeroom today to talk about the incredible ways parents, teachers, and students are coming together to keep learning while schools are closed. \n",
      "\n",
      "48) If we make the right decisions now—informed by science, data and the experience of medical professionals—we can save lives and get the country back to work. You can read more about my thoughts on COVID19 on my blog. \n",
      "\n",
      "49) In the meantime, frontline health care workers are making heroic efforts to test and treat patients across the United States and the world. Here in my hometown, Public Health Seattle ; King County () is doing incredible work that we should all be very proud of.\n",
      "\n",
      "50) All the work that rich countries are doing now to develop vaccines will save lives in developing countries too. Without a vaccine, those countries are at even greater risk than wealthy ones, because it’s even harder for them to do physical distancing and shutdowns.\n",
      "\n",
      "51) If everything goes well, there might be an effective vaccine in less than 18 months—the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. That will depend on decisions we make today, including the federal government investing in building up manufacturing capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "52) Work is going full speed on potential treatments, and vaccines. But people should know that it will take time to prove they are safe and effective and to start making them.\n",
      "\n",
      "53) There’s been some progress on more efficient testing methods, such as the self-swab developed by the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network. I hope this and other innovations in testing are scaled up across the country soon. \n",
      "\n",
      "54) The federal government needs to step up on testing: far more tests should be made available, and we should aggregate the results so we can quickly identify potential volunteers for clinical trials and know with confidence when it’s time to return to normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "55) Extreme physical distancing measures will make a big difference in the U.S., but we need a consistent nationwide approach. Until the case numbers start to go down across America—which could take 10 weeks or more—no one can continue business as usual or relax the shutdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "56) There’s no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel coronavirus. But the window for making important decisions hasn’t closed. The choices we and our leaders make now will have an enormous impact. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "58) One of the questions I am most often asked about the COVID19 pandemic is how, and when, it will end. This article by 209 does a really good job of outlining the steps we need to take. \n",
      "\n",
      "59) This impressive new tool from _UW will help hospitals, policymakers, and the general public better understand and prepare for the COVID19 response in the U.S. \n",
      "\n",
      "60) This is encouraging news, but we still have a lot of work to do. Extreme physical distancing and testing are the best tools we have right now to slow the spread of novel coronavirus. \n",
      "\n",
      "61) There are few people I’ve learned more from over the years–especially about viruses–than Peter Piot. This Q;A with him is an excellent, easy-to-understand primer on COVID19:  \n",
      "\n",
      "62) I’ve been impressed by governors across the country including , , , , , and the many others who are guiding their communities through this challenge and providing a model for us all to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "63) Thanks to Norway and Prime Minister _solberg for their ongoing leadership in global health and important investments in vaccines. \n",
      "\n",
      "64) The international response will require funding for ’s development of a COVID-19 vaccine and for . Thanks to  and the UK for this vital commitment. \n",
      "\n",
      "65) Lots of people in Seattle have asked how they can help those impacted by COVID19 locally.  has done a great job identifying organizations who are already on the ground and deploying resources quickly to help our friends and neighbors:  \n",
      "\n",
      "66) Thanks for your leadership, . This is an inspiring contribution and will make a big difference for families. \n",
      "\n",
      "67) Teachers are doing incredible work to keep kids learning while at home. To help get supplies to those most in need, Melinda and I will double your impact, up to $1 million total, when you give to  coronavirus relief effort today and tomorrow. \n",
      "\n",
      "68) I’m connecting live with  and  to talk about what our healthcare systems need to tackle the COVID19 pandemic and prepare for future epidemics. \n",
      "\n",
      "69) Thanks  for joining me yesterday to discuss the COVID19 pandemic and what we can do to prevent the next one. Here's a recap of the conversation:  \n",
      "\n",
      "70) I know many parents are looking for resources and ideas to help their kids continue learning while home.  has created daily schedules with interactive content--exercises, videos and articles--for students in every grade. \n",
      "\n",
      "71) We don’t yet have all the tools we need to fight COVID-19. This is an important step toward having treatments, while we also explore vaccines and diagnostics. Thanks to  and  for launching this effort with us. \n",
      "\n",
      "72) COVID-19 could be a once-in-a-century pandemic, but the good news is that there are steps we can take now to slow its impact and help us respond more effectively when the next epidemic arrives. COVID19 \n",
      "\n",
      "73) 1 in 4 children under five in South Africa are stunted. The  Campaign is empowering new and pregnant moms to keep their children healthy. Here’s why I’m optimistic that they can make an impact:  \n",
      "\n",
      "74) Melinda and I have met many stunted children in our travels. It’s heartbreaking and utterly preventable. Dr.  is leading an incredible effort to eliminate child stunting from South Africa over the next decade. \n",
      "\n",
      "75) Diseases that cause dementia are only diagnosed after symptoms start. To effectively treat these diseases, we need to be able to diagnose them decades earlier when they first take hold in the brain. \n",
      "\n",
      "76) We’re hopeful that our foundation’s work with Networks for School Improvement will help increase the number of Black, Latinx, and low-income students who graduate from high school and pursue postsecondary opportunities. Here’s why that’s so important:  \n",
      "\n",
      "77) It was a magical night. I'm very happy to support your foundation's incredible work. \n",
      "\n",
      "78) Vaccines are a miracle. But how exactly do they work? I explain the science behind vaccines and why our foundation’s investment in them is one of the best we’ve ever made:  \n",
      "\n",
      "79) Science is giving us the opportunity to improve lives around the world faster than ever before. Today I was honored to give a speech on this subject at the  annual meeting. AAASmtg \n",

      "\n",
      "82) When we first started our foundation, Melinda and I were optimistic about the power of innovation to drive progress. Twenty years later, we’re just as optimistic, and we’re still swinging for the fences:  \n",
      "\n",
      "83) In our new annual letter,  and I write about why we think the risks we’ve taken in the first two decades of our foundation have set us up for future progress. \n",
      "\n",
